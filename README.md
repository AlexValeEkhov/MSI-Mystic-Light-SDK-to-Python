This project is just a Python wrapper for MSI MYSTIC LIGHT SDK library for Windows. I need it for my purposes and didn't find anything useful in internet, so I tryed to make it myself. And it mostly works after all. :)

Most of this project are Python wrapper-functions foe C++ functions in DLL and I made comments for each with copies of C++ functions from Mystic Light Software Development Kit Reference Documentation pdf, provided here with the project.
DLL of x64 and x86 versions also included.
The main function is for demonstration of how it works, but as long as I have only two MSI devices, it is very simple.
You are welcome to try. :)

Requirements: 
MS Windows
MSI Mystic Light
